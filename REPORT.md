DependencyConfusionFinder - Brief comparison report

Goal: Combine strengths of existing dependency confusion detectors and provide a single, more accurate tool.

Summary of other tools (high-level):
- Confuser: fast bulk scanning; sometimes treats registry errors aggressively leading to false positives.
- Confused: CI-focused heuristics and fuzzy matching; can over-report uncommon public names.
- DepFuzzer: fuzzes names and demonstrates exploitability; noisy for detection only.
- Dependency Combobulator: cross-references lockfiles and manifests; good at reducing false positives.

What this tool borrows:
- Static AST parsing to extract imports/requires precisely.
- Conservative registry checking: treat non-404 errors as unknown to avoid false positives.
- Cross-referencing package.json and package-lock.json for accurate versions.
- Filtering of relative imports and Node core modules.

Expected advantages:
- Lower false-positive rate vs tools that mark packages vulnerable on transient network errors.
- Good precision through union of code-level extraction and declared dependency metadata.

Trade-offs:
- Conservative behavior may miss some true positives during transient registry outages.
- Advanced heuristics (popularity checks, similarity scoring) are not included in this version.

Evaluation plan:
- Use a labeled dataset to compute precision/recall vs other tools.
- Tune heuristics for desired precision/recall trade-offs.

Conclusion:
DependencyConfusionFinder is a conservative, modular detector designed for CI integration and future extensibility. The codebase is set up to add more registries, heuristics, and lockfile parsers in follow-up work.
